# Carboxylesterase-Proteins-Analysis
This is the final draft of Project 2. In order to run the code, you will need the 3 FASTA files (included here) and the html file. The FASTA files were obtained from EMBL-EBI. Downloading the pdb files is not necessary if you are able to install and run the required packages. The pdb files should be automatically downloaded into your working directory. 

# Scientific Question
How do the sequences and different types of bonding contribute to the structural similarities and differences between the 2H7C and 2HRQ (Homo sapien) and the 5MIF (Tuber melanosporum) carboxylesterase protein structures? 

# Scientific Hypothesis
If the FASTA and pdb sequences for 2H7C, 5MIF, and 2HRQ are aligned and the protein structure models are compared, then the amount and locations of their bonds between which amino acids can be determined and show how they contribute to the structural differences between species.
